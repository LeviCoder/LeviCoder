# I'm Levi
I make games and stuff on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/LeviCoder/projects),<br>
and am not very active here.

I'm most skilled with JavaScript<br>
(especially Processing.js), but<br>
I'm learning languages such as<br>
C++ and Python. So most of the<br>
stuff you find here will be<br>
experiments or from tutorials.

Happy coding :grin:
